America's Best Cuisine was first created by our very own chef Brad Jones in 1998
and has been serving for 20 years now. 
What sets us apart from other restaurants out there is that we
take pride in what we do including customer service, atmostphere, food quality,etc.
We have been named "Best restaurants in Charlotte" for the 10th consecutive year 
in 2017 and we will try our best to continue our tradition, values
as well as being the best place for food in Charlotte.
